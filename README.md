# Discord.jv
Hey! This is currently a WIP Java Discord API wrapper, called Discord.jv!
Currently, it is very limited in terms of functionality, but that will hopefuly be expanded on shortly :)

This is mostly intended to be a proof of concept, something cool that I made, but when it's finished it will technically be usuabale in a real project, and I'll probably make some bots with it. If you want any more details on the project (how to use it, how I made it etc.), feel free to send me a friend request on Discord and I will usually respond within 12-24 hours.
