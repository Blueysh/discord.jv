# Discord.jv
Hey! This is currently a WIP Java Discord API wrapper, called Discord.jv!
Currently, it is very limited in terms of functionality, but that will hopefuly be expanded on shortly :)

This is mostly intended to be a proof of concept, something cool that I made, but when it's finished it will technically be usuabale in a real project, and I'll probably make some bots with it.
